# Hi, I’m Daniel Mendoza Lozano

I'm a fullstack engineer with over 10 years of experience building real software for real people.

I started coding at 14 with HTML and Visual Basic 6.0, and I’ve been hooked ever since.

Today, I work mostly with:  
- **Languages**: PHP, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript  
- **Frameworks**: Laravel, Django, Node.js, Vue, React  
- **Stack**: Fullstack – from backend architecture to frontend interfaces

## What I do

- **For founders & makers**: I help launch SaaS ideas without overengineering. From MVPs to scale-up.  
- **For companies**: I build and maintain solid, scalable applications as a reliable contractor.  
- **For devs**: I write content to help others get better – from code challenges to productivity tips.
