ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @danielmlozano

I'm a software engineer wirh 10+ years of experience. I started writing HTML and Visual Basic 6.0 when I was 14 years old.

Nowadays, I'm a fullstack engineer, working particularly with PHP, Python, Javascript/Typescript and frameworks/libraries such as Laravel, Django, Vue, React and Node.js.

I'm a natural curious person. I try to learn something new every day.

Currently, I work as Principal Engineer in a Digital Agency, but the fact that I co-founded the agency, forced me to learn about marketing, sales, negotiation and management on multidisciplary teams
